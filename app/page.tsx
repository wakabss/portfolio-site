      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I’m a writer and journalist based between Tokyo and New York City, with bylines in <em>Tokyo Weekender</em>, <em>The Japan Times</em>, <em>Matador Network</em>, <em>Ms.</em> magazine, and more.
      </p>
      <p>  
         Raised across three continents, I’ve flown to Morocco to meet a stranger for a first date, worked undercover as a hostess in Tokyo’s red-light district, and completed a seven-day trek to Machu Picchu without any prior training — all in the name of a good story.
      </p>
      <p>
      My reporting focuses on power and the voices that slip beneath it, seeking stories that are both investigative and deeply human. Alongside cultural reporting and features, I write narrative travel pieces that blend reflection with practical insight.
      </p>  
      <p>
      I also write creative fiction and nonfiction, with work in <em>Panorama: The Journal of Travel, Place, and Nature</em>. These pieces often emerge from the strangeness that shapes my own life.

      <p>
        I’m always open to new and interesting projects!
