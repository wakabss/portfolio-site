        I’m a writer and journalist based between Tokyo and New York City, with bylines in <em>Tokyo Weekender</em>, <em>The Japan Times</em>, <em>Matador Network</em>, <em>Ms.</em> magazine, and more.

        My reporting focuses on power and the voices that slip beneath it, seeking stories that are both investigative and deeply human. I’ve flown to Morocco to meet a stranger for a first date, gone undercover as a hostess in Tokyo’s red-light district, and completed a seven-day trek to Machu Picchu without any prior training — all in the name of a good story.

        In addition to reporting, I write essays, fiction, and the occasional love letter to strange places. My creative work appears in <em>Panorama: The Journal of Travel, Place, and Nature</em>. I also do freelance travel writing when I can, which is just a fancy way of saying I’ll go anywhere if there's something happening.
